         *
         * Basic logic is as follows:
         *
         * - User input event should be acknowledged within 100ms per [RAIL].
         * - Idle work should be grouped in blocks of upto 50ms so that enough time
         *   remains for the event handler to execute and any rendering to take place.
         * - Whenever a native event happens (e.g. user input), the deadline for any
         *   running idle callback drops to 0.
         * - As long as the deadline is non-zero, other callbacks pending may be
         *   executed in the same idle period.
