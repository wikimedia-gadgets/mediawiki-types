# types-mediawiki

TypeScript definitions for MediaWiki JS interface.

This package covers the functions and classes in the `mw` global object, as well a few jQuery plugins used in MediaWiki core. All commonly used parts of the interface are covered but as far as complete coverage is concerned, this is a work in progress.

## Usage

To use types from this package, run

```bash
npm i types-mediawiki
```

Edit your project's `tsconfig.json` file so that it includes

```
"include": [
  "./node_modules/types-mediawiki"
]
```

You should be all set! `mw` will be available in the global scope. There is no need to put any import statements in the TypeScript source files. This package includes [@types/jquery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/jquery) as a dependency, so you don't need to install that separately.

**If you find any errors or have suggestions for more specific typings, please open a PR or file an issue.**

### mw.config

Types for mw.config are included:

```ts
let NS = mw.config.get("wgNamespaceNumber"); // NS gets type number
let pageName = mw.config.get("wgPageName"); // pageName gets type string
```

mw.config entries added by MediaWiki extensions can also be used but their type is not known, so they need to be explicitly cast:

```ts
let namespaces = mw.config.get("pageTriageNamespaces") as number[];
```

(`mw.config.get('pageTriageNamespaces')` gets the type `unknown` without a cast.)

### MediaWiki API parameters

This package also provides typings for API request parameters for the [MediaWiki Action API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page). API endpoints defined in MediaWiki core and by a number of common extensions (the ones enabled on English Wikipedia) are covered. These aren't exported to the global scope, however. For usage, you need to import them. For example:

```ts
import type { ApiEditPageParams, ApiParseParams } from "types-mediawiki/api_params";
```

Since it is just a type import, it doesn't generate any JavaScript. Hence, such imports can also be used in non-modular applications.

## Types for OOjs & OOUI

TypeScript definitions of OOjs and OOUI is available on [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) and npm as [`@types/oojs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/oojs) and [`@types/oojs-ui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/oojs-ui) packages.

## TODO

-   Add doc comments for `mw.ForeignUpload`, `mw.ForeignStructuredUpload`, `mw.GallerySlideshow`, `mw.special.ApiSandbox`, `mw.Upload` and `mw.jqueryMsg` private methods.
-   Add types for more jQuery plugins.
